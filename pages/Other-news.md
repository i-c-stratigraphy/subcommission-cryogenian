On 20th December this year 2024, Professor Shihong Zhang, one of the voting members of the Subcommission on Cryogenian Stratigraphy (International Commission on Stratigraphy) passed away suddenly. Life is truly unpredictable! The sad passing of Shihong is not only a huge loss to his family and his friends, but also to our international geoscience community united by a common passion and interest to find out how Earth evolved.

Shihong is a renowned geologist, specialising in palaeomagnetism and a professor at the China University of Geosciences Beijing. Prior to being on the Cryogenian Subcommission, Shihong made pioneering contributions to the dating of Neoproterozoic glaciations and the positioning of various cratons using palaeomagnetic data. Since he took on his voting member role, he has continuously been an active and earnest contributor whenever needed. His dynamism and support to subcommission activities have been extremely important, especially during the global pandemic, when most science communication took place online. On July 2023, Shihong took part in the subcommission field trip to the island of Garbh Eileach, Scotland, to investigate the key Tonian-Cryogenian transition section there. 
During our joint fieldtrips, subcommission members and I have gradually got to know him as one of the most fun-loving, easy-going, down-to-Earth and kindest of people. The group became instantly livelier whenever Shihong joined. He brought fun, a lot of laughter and ease to conversations, yet he stayed professional throughout and always contributed to field discussions. Shihong was very personable too. One could always talk with him, whether on science related subjects or everyday life. He was always approachable and patient, taking questions seriously, whether from students or colleagues unfamiliar with the field area. Shihong was always curious, not only on subjects related to geology, but also about local culture, cuisine and traditions wherever he went.  Many of us have fond memories of his enthusiasm to taste various single malt whiskies; of stories he told during fieldtrip dinners; of the Beijing opera he was apt to sing; and of the funny jokes with which he made all of us laugh. In his own unique way, Shihong was both a seriously minded scientist to work with and a really fun friend to have. I have been lucky enough to get to know him since 2017 and have become a friend with him. 

Being colleagues and friends, we of the Cryogenian Subcommission are all very sad as Shihongâ€™s life was cut short at the age of 60, and the world has been left with a huge void. Here, we send our condolences to his family. We shall remember how Shihong really made a difference to this science community, as a great scientist driven by his curiosity, dedication, enthusiasm and earnestness, and as a kind, fun-loving, joyful and friendly person.
