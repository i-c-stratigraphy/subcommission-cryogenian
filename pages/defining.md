The Subcommission is the primary body for facilitation of international communication and scientific cooperation in Cryogenian stratigraphy directed at better understanding Earth system evolution during the Cryogenian Period (c.720 â€“ c.635 Ma). Its priority is the unambiguous definition, by means of global stratotype section and points (GSSP), of a hierarchy of chronostratigraphic units that provide the framework for correlation of Cryogenian strata.

Recent years, as the study on different Cryogenian successions globally developed and cumulates, we can start to name several potential Cryogenian base candidates (GSSP). Below are all the relevant publications for each of the candidate.
